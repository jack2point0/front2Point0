Own Up Grown Up is a scheduling and reminder application that bridges the gap between being an adult and actually remembering what adults have to do. Own Up Grown Up's platform makes scheduling all your "adulting" needs fast and reliable.  From car maintenance to home maintenance, Own Up Grown Up has all your scheduling and reminder needs.

Own Up Grown Up was created by TEAM JACK (Julianne Peters, Andrew Garrett, Chris Stubbs, and Kristen McCloud) and includes professional design and security.  Using our application and the Twilio API, you will always get your reminder and always be able to change your personal preferences.

Don't forget to remember, or just use Own Up Grown Up.

  Same logic used in myTaskCard and taskCard to choose icons; we need to move up the state tree to DRY
  Add id to <i> tags so that if no internet connection, still shows something
  Move stylesheets to corresponding page folders
  App.css has a .testing class - what is it used for?
  bodyBox in taskCard and myTaskCard is assigned but never defined in any css file
  Media query for navbar for transition from full to smaller window
  navbar-nav in header styles is only used in a media query. Is there a better way to do this?
